# Hello-World
Code Lagos Playground 
I am a noob python programmer hoping to learn as much as I can from as many sources that are willing and availabel. I kind of believe computer literacy is starting to go beyond the stage of just understanding how to use a keyboard and a mouse but to also understanding how to program your computer in the easiest language it understands...aka programming.
